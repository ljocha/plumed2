## Version 2.9 (under development)

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.9

- Changes leading to differences with previous versions:
  - Number of bins in \ref METAD, \ref PBMETAD and \ref sum_hills is now computed correctly
    when setting a spacing that divide exactly the range.

- New contributed modules:
  - A new pytorch module by Luigi Bonati
     - \ref PYTORCH_MODEL
  - A new membranefusion model by Ary Lautaro Di Bartolo
     - \ref MEMFUSIONP
     - \ref FUSIONPORENUCLEATIONP
     - \ref FUSIONPOREEXPANSIONP

- Other improvements:
  - \ref PBMETAD now supports partitioned families bias thanks to @lemmoi @pfaendtner
  - Construction of atom lists have been optimized (see \issue{811}).
  - SimpleMD has been parallelized with OpenMP. Keyword `maxneighbor` has been removed (not needed anymore).
    In addition, SimpleMD now supports custom values for `epsilon` and `sigma`

- New in LogMFD module:
  - TEMPPD keyword has been newly introduced, which allows for manually setting the temperature of the Boltzmann factor in the Jarzynski weight in LogPD.
  - The output format has been modified to present the CV data in a more consistent way.
  - The algorithm for evaluating the mean force at the initial MFD step has been modified to handle a continued MD trajectory that begins with non-zero timestep number.
